# Project description
This is a  web application,where clients(students) can order amaizing African/Asian dishes and drinks at a student friendly price,they get coupons on their first order.
# Problem statement:
Students have been loosing time trying to find a good,clean and yet affordable cafeteria around the school the closest cafeteria is located atleast 300metres away from the school,which is time consuming especially to Junior developer’s,who at times need enough time to keep up with onerous class work and be at per with the content.To make sure that the students loose no time food hunting,i am developing an online application/cafeteria where  students will order food and drinks online.

# Project Setup:
